ok apparently its no longer a "little game" anymore lmao, im currently in the beginning of implementing the peerJS library, which is borderline lost media, but its also simple enough for me to be able to approach it.

TO-DO LIST:

handle online: decipher approximate of data package train to recieve and send data.
power cards: design special cards for party mode, f3 fair fun and f*ck you.
events: design random events for spontaneity for x gamemode. or scratch the idea.
achievements: collection like in tboi or MMV4, with setIDs.
music and sfx: maybe playful/retro jazz omori vibes potentially.
